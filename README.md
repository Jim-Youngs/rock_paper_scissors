Rock Paper Scissors

This is my first attempt at writing a Javascript program from scratch!

As I begin, I will be focussing on making it properly functional and then once I am successful, I will be designing the GUI.

This will be a great opportunity to practice planning in Pseudocode and to work on developing my commit messages!
